**Please make sure you are NOT reporting a problem about git itself**


- [ ] This is **not** an issue about 
     - the Git documentation (a.k.a. man/help pages, i.e. anything with a URL starting with `https://git-scm.com/docs`), which should be raised with the [community](https://git-scm.com/community),
     - the contents of the Pro Git book (i.e. anything with a URL starting with `https://git-scm.com/book` or its PDF versions), which should be raised at [progit/progit2](https://github.com/progit/progit2/issues).
     - Git itself, which should also be raised with the [community](https://git-scm.com/community), or
     - Git for Windows, which should be raised at [git-for-windows/git](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git).
     - and is actually about the website itself (e.g. website-specific content, JS, or CSS that doesn't seem to be doing its job correctly).
